# 🚗 **Exploring Trends in the Automotive Industry**  

## 📌 **Project Description**  
This project involves an in-depth analysis of **car sales data** to uncover insights into **pricing trends, model performance, and key automotive industry patterns**. The dataset includes details on **car models, pricing history, mileage, transmission types, and other attributes**.  

Using **SQL**, I explored the data to derive insights that can **guide pricing, inventory, and marketing strategies** in the automotive sector. This analysis helps businesses **understand vehicle depreciation, identify high-value models, and optimize sales pricing strategies**.  

## 📂 **Files in This Project**  
📄 **`Exploring Trends in Automotive Industry.sql`** – SQL queries used for analyzing car sales trends, pricing history, and model performance.  
📊 **`Exploring Trends in Automotive Industry.csv`** – The dataset containing details of car sales, including model specifications, mileage, and pricing.  

## 🔍 **Key Tasks Performed**  

✅ **Data Exploration & Validation**  
- Conducted **general data exploration and validation checks** to ensure data consistency and accuracy.  

✅ **Pricing Analysis**  
- **Analyzed average selling prices** based on key factors such as **transmission type, fuel type, and ownership history** to identify pricing patterns.  
- **Computed price variability** within and across models to guide optimal pricing strategy.  
- **Compared pricing and mileage metrics** to overall industry averages to detect outliers and anomalies.  

✅ **Mileage & Durability Analysis**  
- **Identified highest mileage models** to understand durability, maintenance costs, and long-term performance.  
- **Summarized total mileage by transmission type** to aid in maintenance and repair planning.  

✅ **Trend Analysis & Forecasting**  
- **Generated cumulative price trends** over time and conducted **YoY (Year-over-Year) comparisons** for price forecasting.  
- **Computed moving averages** for price smoothing to remove short-term fluctuations and reveal long-term trends.  

✅ **Model Performance & Ranking**  
- **Ranked car models by selling price** and analyzed historical averages for the **top-performing models** in terms of value retention.  
- Compared price trends of different car models to assess **which models depreciate the fastest** and which retain value over time.  

✅ **Advanced SQL Techniques Used**  
- Utilized **WINDOW functions, CTEs (Common Table Expressions), and JOINS** for complex analytical queries.  
- Designed optimized queries for large-scale **iterative analytics** to enhance performance.
